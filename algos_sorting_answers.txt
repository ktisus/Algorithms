1. Write pseudocode for bubble sort.

FUNCTION bubbleSort (array)
DO 
SET SWAPPED to false
  FOR first index of array to last index of collection - 1
    IF array[i] > array[i+1] 
      SET tmp to array[i]
      SET array[i] to array[i+1]
      SET array[i+1]to tmp
      SET SWAPPED to true
    END IF 
  END FOR 
UNTIL SWAPPED equals false
  RETURN collection
END FUNCTION

2. Write pseudocode for quicksort.

FUNCTION quickSort(A)
  IF A less or equal to 1 
    RETURN A
  END IF

  SET pivot to A.length-1 
  SET left to empty array
  SET right to empty array 

  FOR each index in A
   IF A[i] is greater than the pivot 
     PUSH A[i] to right array
   ELSE 
      PUSH A[i] to left array
   END IF 
  END FOR
    REPEAT quickSort function to the right array from pivot
    REPEAT quickSort function to the left array from pivot
    CONCAT both 
END FUNCTION


3. We talked about time complexity in a previous checkpoint, and how to get an idea of the efficiency of an algorithm. After looking at the pseudocode for the above sorting methods, identify why merge sort and quick sort are much more efficient than the others. Walking through each algorithm with a few sample collections may help.
- Both merge sort and quick sort  use ‘Divide and conquer’ principles. In other words, those algorithms split up larger collections into smaller ones and ultimately bring them all back together after the sorting is completed.  
- By manipulating and comparing larger collections, other sorting algorithms  (eg. Bubble sort, Selection sort) lose efficiency in comparison to merge and quick sort.

4. All of the sorts addressed in this checkpoint are known as comparison sorts. Research bucket sort and explain how it works. What is the ideal input for bucket sort?
- Bucket sort is another comparison algorithm that divides elements into buckets then sorts those buckets individually by using recursion or another sorting algorithm.
- The ideal input for bucket sort is elements that are uniformly distributed over a range.
